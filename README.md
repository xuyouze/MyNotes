# This is my notebook about papers in what I have read.
paper list as follow:
* **_ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks_** as **AlexNet.md**
* **_Multi-task learning of cascaded CNN for facial attribute classification PR_** as **FAC.md**
* **_Network In Networks_** as **NIN.md**
* **_VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION_** as **_VGG.md_**

论文的缺陷:
  1. 速度太慢
  *  精度太低
  *  应用场景太简单
  *  泛化能力差
  *  对某些特定问题处理不够好

应对的大体思路:
  1. 样本太小导致的问题，对数据进行增强
  *  对网络组件进行增、删、改
