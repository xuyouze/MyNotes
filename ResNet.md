# Paper Name:
**_Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition_**
# 1. background problem:
  * deeper neural networks are more difficult to train due to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.
  * with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly.

# 2. the proposed methods:
  * in order to address problems as mentioned before,introducing a deep residual learning framework.
# 3. dataset:
  * ILSVRC-2015 top-5 3.57%
  * COCO detection and COCO segmentation
# 4. advantages:

# 5. the detail of methods:
  * residual block
# 6. contribution:

# 7. any questions during the reading :
